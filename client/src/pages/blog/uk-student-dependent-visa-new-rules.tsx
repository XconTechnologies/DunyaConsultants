                  The UK student dependent visa type is one of the most well-known among students who are willing to bring their family members with them. Dependents usually include civil partners, spouses, unmarried partners, and children below eighteen years old.

                  On the other hand, undergraduate as well as postgraduate students might have stricter rules about whether their partner, spouse, or kids can join them while studying in the United Kingdom.

It is essential to understand the eligibility criteria and requirements before applying for a dependent visa UK.

                    <strong>Important Update:</strong> The UK government has introduced new dependent visa rules for international students in 2024. Under these rules, master's students can no longer bring their dependents to the United Kingdom.

This visa allows eligible students to take their family members with them. However, the United Kingdom Home Office has introduced new rules to specify who can bring dependents. Not all.
