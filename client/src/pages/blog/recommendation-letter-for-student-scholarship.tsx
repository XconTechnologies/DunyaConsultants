                      Studying abroad requires a lot of paperwork. One of the most important documents that you must have is the Letter of Recommendation (LOR). This letter is needed when applying to universities or scholarships in other countries. A recommendation letter for student can play a big role in deciding whether you get accepted into a university or not. A strong recommendation can give you an advantage over other applicants, especially if you are looking for financial support or an early decision.
