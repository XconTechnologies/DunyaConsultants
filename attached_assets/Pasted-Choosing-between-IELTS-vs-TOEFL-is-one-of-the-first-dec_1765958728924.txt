Which is easier, TOEFL or IELTS
Summary: It depends on your strengths, not the logo.

Prefer TOEFL iBT if you like computer typing, integrated tasks, and campus-style recordings. Its shorter format and quick scores help tight timelines.
Prefer IELTS if you want a live speaking interview and a choice between paper and computer at centres. For certain visa routes, IELTS at an authorised centre is required.
The real question is not “is toefl or ielts better,” it is which matches your test muscle. Try official samples from both and decide after a single practice day.

Summary: Use these quick profiles to decide faster.

If you are applying to the US and Canada
Both tests are accepted broadly. TOEFL iBT has long US acceptance. IELTS is also widely accepted. Check your department’s note. Use ETS and IELTS “who accepts” tools.

If you want an in-person speaking interview
Pick IELTS. You speak with an examiner. If interviews stress you, simulate with a coach and sample ielts speaking topics.

If you type faster than you write by hand
Pick TOEFL iBT or IELTS on the computer. Both give fast results. IELTS Online exists for Academic, but visa cases often require a centre test.

If your intake is close
TOEFL’s updated test is short with quick reporting. IELTS on computers in Pakistan can also release results quickly. Compare the nearest dates first.
